### Beginners' Tutorial

The BostonRB has developed a small tutorial to acquaint new developers
with some of the features of Ruby On Rails.  It is hosted on 
[Github](http://github.com), a website you will become very familiar 
with.  
Click on the link, scroll down to the README, and follow along with 
the instructions:

Note: This tutorial assumes that you have installed Ruby, Rails, and 
Git.  If you haven't done that yet, try working through our 
[Installation Guide](/install).
