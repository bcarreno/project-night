##Text Editors and IDEs

A text editor allows you to edit files that make up your program.  If you are an experienced programmer coming to Ruby
from another language you probably have a favorite text editor or IDE.

If you are new to programming, try out some of the different options below and see what works best for you.

##Text Editors

If you are an experienced [VI](http://www.vim.org/), [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/), or
[TextMate](http://macromates.com/) user, you probably know you can use them for anything, including Ruby development.

You can also try some of these [other text editors](/text_editors) to get you up and running.


##IDEs and Ruby
Most Rubyists prefer to use just a text editor to develop applications.  Ruby and Rails are known for having
expressive syntax and intuitive APIs, minimizing the need for many of the features, like intelli-sense, that are provided
by typical IDEs.

Rubyists also pride themselves on using a test-driven approach to software development, so there is less emphasis on
using a traditional IDE-based debugger.  Debuggers are still available for Ruby, but the default approach is test-driven.
