### Installing on Mac OS X

We're currently working on our own set of instructions for installing ruby on
Mac OS X, but  the good folks at
[RailsBridge](http://installfest.railsbridge.org/installfest/macintosh) have put
together some great instructions for getting your system set up and
ready to go.

```
We recommend that you skip the Railsbridge section about installing a text
editor and check out [our recommendations](/editors) instead.
