### Installing on Windows

Great news, installing Ruby on Windows is easy!

Try [Ruby Installer for Windows](http://rubyinstaller.org/) to get a
Ruby development environment up and running on Windows.

If you also want to set up for Ruby on Rails development, try
[Rails Installer for Windows](http://railsinstaller.org).

Note: there are some gems and third party libraries that might not play well with Windows. 
While you should be able to develop basic rails applications, gems that require native extensions 
might not properly compile on a Windows machine. When this happens, we recommend that you install 
[VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) 
and configure an Ubuntu virtual machine (http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/virtualbox). Once you have configured this 
instance, you can follow the [Ubuntu Linux Installation Guide](/install/ubuntu)
