### Why Consider a Text Editor?

Most Rubyists prefer to use just a text editor to develop applications.  Ruby
and Rails are known for having expressive syntax and intuitive APIs, minimizing
the need for many of the features, like intelli-sense, that are provided by
typical IDEs.

Rubyists also pride themselves on using a test-driven approach to software
development, so there is less emphasis on using a traditional IDE-based
debugger.  Debuggers are still available for Ruby, but the default approach is
test-driven.

If you prefer using an IDE, the following IDEs are supported on multiple
platforms (Windows, Mac, and Linux). Check the vendor documentation for
instructions on how to set up and install the IDE for Ruby on your OS.

### [RubyMine](http://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/)
[RubyMine](http://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/) is put out by JetBrains, the folks
that brought you TeamCity and IntelliJ.  If you are a Java developer coming to
Ruby from IntelliJ, or are a .NET developer using Visual Studio and ReSharper,
RubyMine will be a familiar environment.  RubyMine has good intelli-sense to
help get you started.

RubyMine has a free 30 day trial and at the time of writing a personal license
of $69.

### [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/)
[Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/) provides a plug-in for Ruby development. This
[link](http://mhreviews.wordpress.com/2011/04/17/april-17-2011-start-using-eclipse-to-develop-ruby-programs/)
has some instructions to help you get set up and running under Eclipse.


### [NetBeans](http://wiki.netbeans.org/RubySupport)
[NetBeans](http://wiki.netbeans.org/RubySupport) dropped support for Ruby
starting in version 7, but you can install version 6.9.1 for Ruby support.
