### Why Consider a Text Editor?

Most Rubyists prefer to use just a fairly light-weight text editor to develop applications.  Ruby and Ruby on Rails
are known for having expressive syntax and intuitive APIs, reducing the need for many of the features,
like intelli-sense, that are typically provided by typical IDEs.

Rubyists pride themselves on using a test-driven approach to software development, so there is less need for a
traditional IDE-based debugger.  Debuggers are still available for Ruby, but the default approach is
test-driven first.

If you would like an IDE, the following IDEs are supported on multiple
platforms (Windows, Mac, and Linux). Check the vendor documentation for
instructions on how to set up and install the IDE for Ruby on your OS.

### [RubyMine](http://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/)
[RubyMine](http://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/) is put out by JetBrains, the folks that brought you TeamCity and IntelliJ.
If you are a Java developer coming to Ruby from IntelliJ, or are a .NET developer using Visual Studio and ReSharper,
RubyMine will be a familiar environment to you.
RubyMine has a free 30 day trial and at the time of writing a personal license of $69.

### [Aptana Studio](http://aptana.com/products/studio3)
