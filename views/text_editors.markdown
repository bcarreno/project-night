##SublimeText 2
[SublimeText 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) is a great text editor, available on all platforms (Mac, Linux, and Windows).
It has a free trial and at the time of writing a single-developer license is $59.

##Notepad++
[Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/) is similar to Notepad, but also has some nice features built-in
to support programming.  It allows multiple documents to be opened at once through a tabbed windows interface.
This is a good option for getting up and running with Ruby on Windows without purchasing an IDE.  Notepad++ is free
and is only available for Windows.
