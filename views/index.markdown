## what
### BostonRB Project Night #1

Beginners' corner stuff here

## when
### June Something

We seriously shouldn't be using this for scheduling information, but this
should make it pretty clear how this works.

```ruby
def a_method(*args)
  p args
end
```

```
code with no type (a hack for important stuff)
```

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Foo</title>
    <script src="foo"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    ok!
  </body>
</html>
```

Hope this helps!
