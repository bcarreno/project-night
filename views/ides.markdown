## Cross-Platform IDEs
If you prefer using an IDE, the following IDEs are supported on multiple platforms (Windows, Mac, and Linux).
Check the vendor documentation for instructions on how to set up and install the IDE for Ruby on your OS.

##RubyMine
[RubyMine](http://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/) is put out by JetBrains, the folks that brought you TeamCity, JIRA, and
IntelliJ.  If you are a Java developer coming to Ruby from IntelliJ, or are a .NET developer using Visual Studio and
ReSharper, RubyMine will be a familiar environment.  RubyMine has good intelli-sense to help get you started.

RubyMine has a free 30 day trial and at the time of writing a personal license of $69.

##Eclipse
[Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/) provides a plug-in for Ruby development.  This
[link](http://mhreviews.wordpress.com/2011/04/17/april-17-2011-start-using-eclipse-to-develop-ruby-programs/) has some
instructions to help you get set up and running under Eclipse.


##NetBeans
[NetBeans](http://wiki.netbeans.org/RubySupport) dropped support for Ruby starting in version 7, but you can install
version 6.9.1 for Ruby support.
